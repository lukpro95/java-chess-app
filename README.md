# java-chess-app

My first big project in Java - making Chess Game.

What we can do:
- play versus self,
- play versus simple bots (randomizing choices),
- play online: hosting and joining hosted games via official IPs and configured PORTs,
- changing settings / names / board-styles,
- chatting online,
- WINNING :)

Following standard SOLID as much as I could make it.
